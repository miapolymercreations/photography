 bio: "Hello and welcome!
I was first introduced to polymer clay in 2021. It all started with making DIY gifts for family during the holidays. I slowly fell into the rabbit hole of YouTube and after many videos and multiple runs to Michaelâ€™s I found myself lost in the world of making small clay trinkets.

I am still learning and expanding my skills in polymer clay."
